In this blog post, we are going to make a super cool web scraper! Here’s a link to my project repository: https://github.com/GraceShi0321/IMDB_SCRAPER  

## §1. describe how scraper works

 Here’s how we set up the project:


```python
from scrapy.spiders import Spider
from scrapy.http import Request

# Our scraper is a class. 
# Our scraper subclasses the scrapy.Spider class.  
class ImdbSpider(Spider):
    """
    A simple spider class to illustrate scraping the IMBd site by going from one's favorite movie or TV show site
    to crawl and extract other movies and TV shows that also star the cast of one's favorite movie or TV show. 
    
    The scraped information will be saved in a csv file when crawling the spider
    The location of the files saved are controlled by settings.py
    """ 
    name       = 'imdb_spider'
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/'] # the starting point
```

Now, we will implement three parsing methods for the ImdbSpider class.

### 1. parse(self, response)
Will navigate to the Cast & Crew page


```python
# A response is an object corresponding to a webpage; 
# It contains the raw HTML as well as a number of useful attributes and methods for extracting information from the page. 
def parse(self, response):
        """
        This function assumes you start on a movie or TV show page, 
        and then navigate to the Cast & Crew page
        """
        # first get the link of the Cast & Crew page
        Cast_Crew_URL = response.css("a.ipc-metadata-list-item__icon-link")[0].attrib["href"]
        prefix        = "https://www.imdb.com"
        CastCrew_URL  = prefix + Cast_Crew_URL
        # Once there, the parse_full_credits(self,response) should be called
        yield Request(CastCrew_URL, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
```

### 2. parse_full_credits(self, response)
Will yield a scrapy.Request for the page of each actor listed on the page


```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
        """
        This function assumes that you start on the Cast & Crew page. 
        Its purpose is to yield a scrapy.Request for the page of each actor/actress listed on the page.
        Crew members are not included.
        """
        # get the link of each actor/actress listed on the page
        cast_links    = response.css("td.primary_photo").css("a:first-child")
        cast_suffixes = [link.attrib["href"] for link in cast_links]
        cast_URL      = ["https://www.imdb.com" + suffix for suffix in cast_suffixes]
        # the method parse_actor_page(self, response) should be called when the actor/actress’s page is reached
        for url in cast_URL:    
            yield Request(url, callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```

### 3. parse_actor_page(self, response)
Will yield dictionary with two key-value pairs


```python
 def parse_actor_page(self, response):
        """
        This function assumes you start on the page of an actor/actress. 
        It yields a dictionary with two key-value pairs, of the form 
        {"actor/actress" : actor_name, "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name}
        """
        # get the name of the actor/actress
        ActorActress_name = response.css("span.itemprop::text")[0].get()
        # get all movies and TV shows for this actor/actress
        works             = response.css('div[id*="filmo-head-act"] + div.filmo-category-section div[class*="filmo-row"] b a:first-child::text')
        works             = [work.get() for work in works]
        for movie_or_TV_name in works:
            yield {
                    "actor/actress" : ActorActress_name,
                    "movie_or_TV_name": movie_or_TV_name
                    }
```

Now run the following command to run our spider to create a .csv file with a column for actors and a column for movies or TV shows.


```python
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o movies.csv
```

Now we are ready to make some recommendations

## §2. the results of analysis


```python
import pandas as pd
```

Read the .csv file that was created by crawling our spider, and take a look at it 


```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GraceShi0321/IMDB_SCRAPER/main/IMDB_scraper/results.csv"
results = pd.read_csv(url)
results
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>actor/actress</th>
      <th>movie_or_TV_name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Charles Thomas Allen</td>
      <td>Friends</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>John Christopher Allen</td>
      <td>Friends</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Cynthia Mann</td>
      <td>Glenn Martin DDS</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Cynthia Mann</td>
      <td>Death of a Saleswoman</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Cynthia Mann</td>
      <td>King of the Hill</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>...</th>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>49011</th>
      <td>Alison Sweeney</td>
      <td>I Married Dora</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>49012</th>
      <td>Alison Sweeney</td>
      <td>The Magical World of Disney</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>49013</th>
      <td>Alison Sweeney</td>
      <td>St. Elsewhere</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>49014</th>
      <td>Alison Sweeney</td>
      <td>Webster</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>49015</th>
      <td>Alison Sweeney</td>
      <td>Simon &amp; Simon</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>49016 rows × 2 columns</p>
</div>



Now we want to compute a sorted list with the top movies and TV shows that share actors with my TV show


```python
sorted_works = results.groupby(["movie_or_TV_name"]).count().sort_values(by=['actor/actress'], ascending=False)
sorted_works = sorted_works.rename(columns = {"actor/actress" : "Number of Shared Actors/Actress"})
sorted_works.head(20)
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Number of Shared Actors/Actress</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>movie_or_TV_name</th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Friends</th>
      <td>823</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>ER</th>
      <td>182</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</th>
      <td>134</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Seinfeld</th>
      <td>122</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>NCIS</th>
      <td>110</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>NYPD Blue</th>
      <td>105</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Criminal Minds</th>
      <td>95</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Diagnosis Murder</th>
      <td>92</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Grey's Anatomy</th>
      <td>90</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Days of Our Lives</th>
      <td>88</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>The West Wing</th>
      <td>86</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Without a Trace</th>
      <td>83</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Charmed</th>
      <td>83</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>The Drew Carey Show</th>
      <td>83</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Bones</th>
      <td>82</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>CSI: Miami</th>
      <td>81</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Beverly Hills, 90210</th>
      <td>79</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Providence</th>
      <td>77</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Judging Amy</th>
      <td>76</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Desperate Housewives</th>
      <td>74</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



Impressive! That will be all for today~
