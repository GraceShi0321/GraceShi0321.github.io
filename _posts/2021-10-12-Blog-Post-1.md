Inside this Blog Post, we are going to construct several interesting, interactive data graphics using the NOAA climate data that we’ve explored in the first several weeks of lectures

## §1. Create a Database

Here are all the libraries and packages that we will need for this Blog Post


```python
import pandas as pd
# for writing and executing sql queries
import sqlite3   
# advanced plotting tools for data frames
import seaborn as sns 
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
# for interative visualization
from plotly import express as px
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from plotly.io import write_html
```

In order to proceed, we will need to connect to a database and then interact with it. Since it is the first time we are connecting to the BlogPost1.db, this database will be created in the currect directory 


```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("BlogPost1.db")
```

In order to read data and use data more smoothly, here is a function that we will use to clean up and better prepare the data we will need


```python
def prepare_df(df):
    # for each unique combination of "ID" and "Year", we want all its numerical temeprature values into one column instead of 12 columns
    # First, we need to convert all the columns that we don't want to stack into a multi-index for the data frame. 
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    # Then, we call the stack() method. This has the effect of "stacking" all of the data values on top of each other. 
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    # rename some columns to get our desired column names
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    df["FIPS_10-4"] = df["ID"].str[0:2]
    return(df)
```

We can think of a table as a data frame-like object, represented in SQLite rather than in Python. The `df.to_sql()` method writes to a specified table in the database (the `conn` object from earlier). We need to specify `if_exists` to ensure that we add each piece to the table, rather than overwriting them each time. 


```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df)
    # "temperatures" is the name of table, one database can hold a lot tables 
    # we use append so that if sth. already there, we do not overwrite
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)
```

Here we will create a new table named `stations` in our database


```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(url)
# get the country code of each station
stations["FIPS_10-4"] = stations["ID"].str[0:2]
# write table to the database, replace if there is already a table named stations
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

Similarly, we will also add a tabled called `countries` into our database


```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(url)
# rename some columns so no warning about having spaces in column names will be issued
countries = countries.rename(columns = {"FIPS 10-4" : "FIPS_10-4", "ISO 3166" : "ISO_3166", "Name" : "Country"})
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

Now we have a database containing three tables. Let's just check that this is indeed the case.


```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")
print(cursor.fetchall())
```

    [('temperatures',), ('stations',), ('countries',)]
    

Yeahhh~ We have successfully done that!   
Now, it's good practice to close your database connection once you're done using it.   


```python
conn.close()
```

## §2. Write a Query Function

We will now write a function called query_climate_database() which will return a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the year


```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """
    four arguments:
    -country: a string giving the name of a country for which data should be returned.
    -year_begin and year_end: two integers giving the earliest and latest years for which should be returned.
    -month: an integer giving the month of the year for which should be returned.
    
    the return value is a dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the year
    """
    
    # here is the SQL query string that we will use to get the data we want
    # we will be selecting data from three tables that we have created above
    # we can join tables based on the common column that tables share
    # the where clause will filter out the specific rows that satisfy our requirements
    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.Country, T.year, T.month, T.temp
    FROM temperatures T
    INNER JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    INNER JOIN countries C ON T.`FIPS_10-4` = C.`FIPS_10-4`  
    WHERE C.Country = '{country}' AND T.year >= {year_begin} AND T.year <= {year_end} AND T.month = {month}
    """
    # Read SQL query into a DataFrame
    # Returns a DataFrame corresponding to the result set of the query string
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    return(df)
```

We will need to again connect to our database in order to perform SQL queries


```python
# here we are refering to a db alreay exist, we can interact with it now
conn = sqlite3.connect("BlogPost1.db")
```

We are now ready to use the function we have defined above to get the data we wanted, here is an example:  
Here we are trying to find the data for January during years 1980-2020 in India


```python
query_climate_database(country = "India", 
                       year_begin = 1980, 
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
```

We are now ready to make some interesting visualizations! Let's GO!

## §3. Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases

### For this part, we will write a function to create visualizations that address the following question:   
*How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?*

we will first define a function that can compute the first coefficient of a linear regression model 


```python
def coef(data_group):
    x = data_group[["Year"]] # 2 brackets because X should be a df
    y = data_group["Temp"]   # 1 bracket because y should be a series
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return LR.coef_[0]  # the fisrt coefficient is the slope
```

The output of this function will be an interactive geographic scatterplot, constructed using Plotly Express, with a point for each station, such that the color of the point reflects an estimate of the yearly change in temperature during the specified month and time period at that station


```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    """
    arguments:
    -country, year_begin, year_end, and month are as in the previous part.
    -min_obs: the minimum required number of years of data for any given station. 
    **kwargs, additional keyword arguments passed to px.scatter_mapbox(). 
    
    the return value is an interactive geographic scatterplot with a point for each station, such that the color of the point reflects an estimate of the yearly change in temperature during the specified month and time period at that station
    """
    
    # use the fuction we defined in the previous part to get the temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the time period
    df = query_climate_database(country, 
                                year_begin, 
                                year_end, 
                                month)
    # find the number of years of data for each station
    df["range"] = df.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(np.max) - df.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(np.min) + 1
    # only keep rows that satisfy the minimum required number of years of data for any given station
    df = df[df["range"] >= min_obs]
    # apply the function above to get the first coefficient of a linear regression model 
    coefs = df.groupby(["NAME"]).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    coefs = coefs.rename(columns = {0 : "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"})
    # rounded the numbers to a sober number of significant figures
    coefs["Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"] = coefs["Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"].round(4)
    df = pd.merge(df, coefs, on = ["NAME"])  
    months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", 
             "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
    # to create our visualization using the Plotly package
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(df, # pass in a dataframe
                            lat = "LATITUDE",
                            lon = "LONGITUDE",
                            hover_name = "NAME", # station name is shown when hover over the corresponding point on the map
                            hover_data = ["LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE","Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"],
                            color = "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)",
                            range_color=[-0.15,0.15],
                            height = 300,
                            title = f"Estimates of yearly increase in temperature in {months[month-1]} for stations in {country}, years {year_begin} - {year_end}",
                            **kwargs)
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    return(fig)
```

Now we are ready to use the funtion we have defined to create visualizations:  
Here we are tring to see estimates of yearly increase in temperature in january for stations in India during 1980-2020


```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap

# pass in the country name, the beginning year, the end year, the chosen month, the minimum required number of years of data, and some other keyword arguments for px.scatter_mapbox()
fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)

write_html(fig, "S3plot.html")
```
{% include S3plot.html %}

From this graph we see that many stations in India indeed are experiencing positive changes in temperatures in January during the given period. This visualization can be used as an indication that global warming is truly happening in the world and people should take actions. 

## §4. Create More Interesting Figures

### The first question we want to answer is:   
*Even though the temperature values we have are already the average for a given month in a given year, but since usually temperatures are still relatively stable inside the same month, could we use these average temperatures to detect some months with anomalies in their temperatures? Also, for a specific country, will there be any regions that tend to have more anamolies in temperatures than other areas?*

Here we will define a function to compute z-scores of an array


```python
def z_score(x):
    m = np.mean(x)
    s = np.std(x)
    return (x - m)/s
```

We will now define a function that will return an interactive geographic scatterplot, constructed using Plotly Express, with a point for each station that contains anomalies in the average temperture for a give month during a given time period, such that the color of the point reflects the number of anomalies this staion experienced during the specified month and time period at that station


```python
def temperature_anomalies_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs,**kwargs):
    """
    arguments:
    -country, year_begin, year_end, and month are as in the previous part.
    -min_obs: the minimum required number of years of data for any given station. 
    **kwargs, additional keyword arguments passed to px.scatter_mapbox(). 
    
    the return value is an interactive geographic scatterplot with a point for each station that contains anomalies in the average temperature for a give month during a given time period
    """
    # use the fuction we defined in the previous part to get the temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the time period
    df = query_climate_database(country, 
                                year_begin, 
                                year_end, 
                                month)
    # only keep rows that satisfy the minimum required number of years of data for any given station
    df["range"] = df.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(np.max) - df.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(np.min) + 1
    df = df[df["range"] >= min_obs] 
    # to compute the z-score for the temperature values of each station
    df["z"] = df.groupby(["NAME"])["Temp"].transform(z_score)
    df["z"] = df["z"].round(2)
    # create a new column for plotting usage later
    df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Year"].astype(str) + "-" + df["Month"].astype(str)) 
    # we define an anomaly to be a data value with a z-score greater than 2
    anomalies = df[np.abs(df["z"]) > 2]
    # find the number of anomalies each station has
    anomalies = anomalies.groupby(["NAME"])["z"].aggregate([len])
    anomalies = anomalies.rename(columns = {"len" : "Number of Anomalies Detected"})
    anomalies = pd.merge(anomalies, df, on = ["NAME"]) 
    anomalies = anomalies.drop_duplicates(subset =["LATITUDE",  "LONGITUDE", "NAME"])
    months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", 
             "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
    # to create our visualization using the Plotly package
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(anomalies, # pass in a dataframe
                        lat = "LATITUDE",
                        lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                        hover_name = "NAME", 
                        hover_data = ["LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE","Number of Anomalies Detected"],
                        color = "Number of Anomalies Detected", # change color according to the column specified
                        height = 300,
                        title = f"Number of Anomalies Detected in {months[month-1]} for stations in {country}, years {year_begin} - {year_end}",
                        **kwargs)                
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    
    return(fig)
```

Now we are ready to use the funtion we have defined to create visualizations:  
Here we are tring to see how many stations in China have detected anomalies in temperatures in January during 1980-2020


```python
color_map = px.colors.qualitative.Pastel
fig = temperature_anomalies_plot("China", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)

From this visulization, we see the majority of regions in China have all experienced anomalies in temperature in January during the time period. Since the data we have are already the average temperature for a month in a year, an anomaly in this case then is an indication that the whole month is probably experiencing some anomalies in temperatures comparing to other years of the same month. This visualization can be used to serve as a signal that there are temperature changes happening in places around the world.  

### A second question we want to find out more about is:
*During a time period, within a specific country, will stations in different locations experience differnt changes in temperatures for a given month?*

We will now define a function to compare the temperature changes in different stations of a country in a given month during a period of years


```python
def temperature_line_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, stations,**kwargs):
    """
    arguments:
    -country, year_begin, year_end, and month are as in the previous part.
    -station: a list of stations that wanted to make comparisons. 
    **kwargs, additional keyword arguments passed to px.scatter_mapbox(). 
    
    the return value is an interactive geographic line plot that compares the temperature changes in different stations of a country in a given month during a period of years
    """
    # use the fuction we defined in the previous part to get the temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the time period
    df = query_climate_database(country, 
                                year_begin, 
                                year_end, 
                                month)
    # only keep rows that contain data about the stations wanted
    df = df[df["NAME"].isin(stations)]
    df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Year"].astype(str) + "-" + df["Month"].astype(str))
    months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", 
             "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
    # to create our visualization using the Plotly package
    fig = px.line(df, # pass in a dataframe
             x = "Date", 
             y = "Temp",
             color = "NAME",
             hover_name = "NAME", 
             hover_data = ["Date", "Temp"],
             facet_col = "NAME", # Facetting refers to creating multiple, small plots, each of which display a subset of the data
             height = 300,
             title = f"The Average Temperatures(°C) in {months[month-1]} for Specified Stations in {country} during years {year_begin} - {year_end}",
             **kwargs)
                         
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    
    return(fig)
```

Now we are ready to use the funtion we have defined to create visualizations:  
Here we are tring to see how the temperature changes in two different stations of China in January during a given time period


```python
fig = temperature_line_plot("China", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   ["SHANGHAI", "NANJING"])

write_html(fig, "S4plot2.html")
```

Even though the distance between the two places is about three-hours' drive, the SHANGHAI station tends to have higher average temperatures than the NANJING station generally for January during the time period. Other than that, the overall trend for average temperatures in January is similar for the two stations. Even though there are some major ups and downs happening, we can still see that the overall trend for both stations in average temperatures in January is increasing. This visualization can also be used to indicate that global warming is indeed happening. 

In addition to line graphs, we can also utilize boxplots to compare temperatures in different statsion


```python
def temperature_box_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, stations,**kwargs):
    """
    here we pass in the same arguments as the function defined above; however, we will return boxplots in this function
    """
    # use the fuction we defined in the previous part to get the temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the time period
    df = query_climate_database(country, 
                                year_begin, 
                                year_end, 
                                month)
    # only keep rows that contain data about the stations wanted
    df = df[df["NAME"].isin(stations)]
    df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Year"].astype(str) + "-" + df["Month"].astype(str))
    months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", 
             "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
    # to create our visualization using the Plotly package
    fig = px.box(df, 
             x = "NAME", 
             y = "Temp",
             color = "NAME",
             height = 300,
             title = f"Comparison of Average Temperatures(°C) in {months[month-1]} for Specified Stations in {country} in years {year_begin} - {year_end}",
             **kwargs)
                         
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    
    return(fig)
```

Now we are ready to use the funtion we have defined to create visualizations:  
Here we are tring to use boxplots to compare average temperatures in two different stations of China in January during a given time period


```python
fig = temperature_box_plot("China", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   ["SHANGHAI", "NANJING"])

var gd = document.getElementById('b33ca634-cdab-4384-8557-9340bdace177');
var x = new MutationObserver(function (mutations, observer) {{
        var display = window.getComputedStyle(gd).display;
        if (!display || display === 'none') {{
            console.log([gd, 'removed!']);
            Plotly.purge(gd);
            observer.disconnect();
        }}
}});

// Listen for the removal of the full notebook cells
var notebookContainer = gd.closest('#notebook-container');

    x.observe(notebookContainer, {childList: true});

// Listen for the clearing of the current output cell
var outputEl = gd.closest('.output');

                        })                };                });            </script>        </div>


In this case, no conclusion about trends in temperatures can be drawn. However, we can still see that the temperatures tend to be higher in the SHANGHAI staion than the NANJING station in January during the given period.

### Lastly, another question we would want to answer is:
*For a given time period and a given month, how will the averages temperatures of two different contries be different?*

Here we want to define a function that will return a histogram for the temperatures of a given country in a given month for a specified time period


```python
def temperature_histo_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, **kwargs):
    """
    -country, year_begin, year_end, and month are as in the previous part.
    the return of this function will be a histogram for the temperatures of a given country in a given month for a specified time period
    """
     # use the fuction we defined in the previous part to get the temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the time period
    df = query_climate_database(country, 
                                year_begin, 
                                year_end, 
                                month)
    months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", 
             "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
    # to create our visualization using the Plotly package
    fig = px.histogram(df, 
             x = "Temp", 
             nbins = 30, 
             height = 300,
             title = f"The Average Temperatures(°C) in {months[month-1]} in {country} in year {year_begin}",
             **kwargs)                   
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    
    return(fig)
```

Now we are ready to use the funtion we have defined to create visualizations:  
Here we want to create histograms to compare temperatures in China and India in January during a given time period


```python
fig = temperature_histo_plot("China", 2020, 2020, 1)
write_html(fig, "S4plot4.html")
fig = temperature_histo_plot("India", 2020, 2020, 1)
write_html(fig, "S4plot5.html")
```
{% include S4plot4.html %}
{% include S4plot5.html %}

From these two histograms, we can see that India tends to be warmer than China in January for the given time period. While all the temperatures are positive values for India in January, there are still many places in China experiencing temperatures below 0°C in January.

Don't forget to close the database connection!


```python
conn.close()
```

That will be all for today's visualizations. We have learned so much about data manipulation, plotting and temperatures!
